  While working at Woolworth's in Toronto, Alice met Thomas Newbury. They met
  because his brother married one of the other girls Alice worked with. He used
  to sing "I found a million dollar baby in the five and ten". Thomas and Alice
  were married in Toronto on September 22, 1921 - that was Alice's 21st
  birthday. She was about 2 weeks older than Tom and there was a fair bit of
  teasing about him being "just a kid". Before they left Toronto they had seven
  children, George (1922), Raymond (1923), William (1925), Thomas (1927),
  Shirley (1928), Elizabeth (1930) and Connie (1933).</span

  Tom had come ahead first to take a job as a linotype operator at Hanson and
  Edgar Limited. Hanson and Edgar's was located near the Queen's Inn - Brock
  Street near Bagot. He lived in a house on University Ave. where a Mrs. Bruton
  looked after the house for the man who owned it. When the rest of the family
  arrived they rented a house around the corner on Earl St. - it may have been
  called the "Stone Jug". When they moved in it was so cold that the pipes had
  frozen. The boys were always into things - like the coal yards and the

  After six months Alice and Tom decided it would be better to move the kids to
  the 'country', which at that time meant "The Point" at Barriefield. Tom could
  walk to work from there and Alice raised chickens and geese to sell. Their
  nearest neighbours were Dollar Bill and Duncan Stewart's family. Dollar Bill
  lived in a steel hanger suitable for water planes. Well known for his
  bootlegging, he also had a store in there with candy for the kids. Shirley
  remembers sitting on his couch with a cup of Oxo that he insisted she stir
  until it was completely dissolved.</span

  In 1943 they moved to a house owned by Mrs. Rett Brawley somewhere around

  would have been through Kingston. Shirley remembers the farmer across the road
  helping them burn some brush - it ended up getting out of control and the
  fence posts burned as well. Mrs Brawley, who lived in part of the house,
  probably though this was a wild bunch.</span
