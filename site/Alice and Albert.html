<div class="callme">Alice was my great-grandmother, if she was yours too, help me fill in the blanks. There are a lot of holes in this story. I'm working on scanning all the photos and cards my grandmother had, hopefully that will help someone connect this to themselves. My contact info is at the bottom. </div>

Greetings - On December 4th, 2009, this page moved to <a href="LathamAliceElizabeth.html">http://post.queensu.ca/~youngjy/familytree/LathamAliceElizabeth.html</a>. Now that information is flowing in from more of Alice Elizabeth's decendants the focus of the page has changed from just Alice and Albert to include Edward, Violet and William as well. 

<h1>Decendants of Alice:</h1>
<p>Alice (1900), Edward (1904), Albert (1906), Violet (1908), William (1909)</p>
